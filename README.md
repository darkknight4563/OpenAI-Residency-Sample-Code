# Building AI Course Project: Crypto Currency Trading System

Final project for the Building AI course.

## Summary

This endeavor explores a novel approach of intertwining AI's analytical power with the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies to craft a basic trading system. The primary aim is to alleviate the hurdles faced by human traders such as emotional biases and manual data analysis, by employing AI to generate trading signals based on market trends and potential price movements. The exploration of this idea is embarked upon with a conservative stance, excluding complex or risky trading strategies, to ensure a solid foundation before advancing to more intricate methods.

## Background

The fascination with cryptocurrency trading has surged, yet the journey is often impeded by human emotions and the tiresome manual search for trading opportunities. This project advocates for a symbiotic relationship between human intuition and AI's computational prowess, aiming to capitalize on each's strengths while mitigating their weaknesses. Initially, the scope is narrowed down to basic trading strategies ensuring a controlled and manageable environment for the project to thrive.

## How is it used?

The system is conceived to first serve personal trading endeavors, with a vision of scaling it up to aid the wider retail trading community. The figure below sketches a rudimentary model of the envisaged AI-based trading solution, hinting at broader considerations like risk management and transaction costs which, for now, rest on human discretion.

## Data sources and AI methods

The project leans on diverse data sources ranging from daily crypto trading stats, market indices, to various other metrics from platforms like CoinMarketCap, TradingView, and others. At its core, logistic regression will steer the AI's classification tasks, yet the doors are open for future expansion into deep learning and sentiment analysis, harnessing a spectrum of data for well-rounded decision-making.

## Challenges

A few challenges loom ahead:

1. Engrossment in details
2. Over-stretching the project scope
3. Uncertainty in finding a working solution

Addressing these challenges hinges on adhering to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach, ensuring a focused and pragmatic stride towards the goals set. The absence of a working solution, albeit unlikely, still holds value in the lessons learned and the knowledge acquired.

## What next?

The roadmap ahead encompasses detailed understanding of the trading domain, data gathering, model development, and iterative testing. The process, although outlined in a linear fashion, embraces an iterative nature, constantly revisiting previous steps for refinement. Beyond the current project, there's potential for evolving into a full-fledged algorithmic trading strategy, possibly venturing into a subscription-based service model aiding retail traders.
